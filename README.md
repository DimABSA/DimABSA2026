# Overview

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is the task of identifying the aspect terms and their associated sentiment polarity in text. Since the success of previous SemEval tasks (Pontiki et al., 2014; 2015; 2016), ABSA has become a widely studied research area.  

However, current ABSA research adopts a coarse-grained, categorical sentiment representation (e.g., positive, negative, and neutral). This is in sharp contrast to the long-standing theoretical foundations in psychological and affective science (Russell, 1980; 2003) where sentiment is represented by fine-grained real-valued scores of **valence** (negative to positive) and **arousal** (sluggish to excited) dimensions, as shown in Fig. 1. 

Such a valence-arousal (VA) representation has driven the rise of dimensional sentiment analysis as an emerging research paradigm (Mohammad, 2018; Mohammad et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2022, 2024; Muhammad et al., 2025), enabling nuanced distinctions in emotional expression and supporting a wide range of applications.

</p>

Here, for the first time, we introduce a SemEval shared task that aims to bridge this gap by integrating dimensional sentiment analysis into the traditional (categorical) ABSA framework. Specifically, given a textual instance, participating systems are expected to predict real-valued valence and arousal scores towards the relevant aspect. We refer to this new task as dimensional ABSA (DimABSA). The proposed DimABSA task has the following features
- This task captures sentiment in a more nuanced manner by using real-valued valence and arousal scores, whereas previous ABSA tasks have treated sentiment in a categorical way (e.g., positive and negative).
- This task constructs datasets from three application areas: customer reviews, financial reports, and stance detection, whereas previous ABSA tasks have focused primarily on customer review data. 
- This task covers 16 languages spoken across Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America, and Europe, including both high-resource and low-resource languages. These include eight African languages (Emakhuwa, Hausa, Igbo, Kinyarwanda, Mozambican Portuguese, Swahili, Twi, Xhosa), as well as Chinese, English, German, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, and Tatar.

# Task Description 
We introduce dimensional sentiment representation into three traditional ABSA subtasks: Aspect Sentiment Classification (ASC), Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE), and Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP), which involve the analysis of aspect terms, aspect categories, opinion terms, and sentiment polarity in given sentences. By replacing sentiment polarity with valence-arousal scores, we propose three new corresponding dimensional subtasks: Dimensional Aspect Sentiment Regression (DimASR), Dimensional Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (DimASTE), and Dimensional Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (DimASQP). The resulting elements to be predicted in the new subtasks are described as follows. Among them, only the Valence-Arousal (VA) element is newly introduced; the others are identical to those in traditional ABSA.

- Aspect Term: refers to a word or phrase indicating an opinion target, such as *appetizer*, *waiter*, *battery*, or *screen*.
- Aspect Category: refers to the abstract or predefined category to which an aspect term belongs. It is denoted in the format *Entity#Attribute*, where the Entity (e.g., FOOD, SERVICE) and the Attribute (e.g., PRICES, QUALITY) are both selected from predefined lists (Pontiki et al., 2015). For all valid combinations, see the [full list of aspect categories](#full-list-of-aspect-categories).
- Opinion Term: refers to a sentiment-bearing word or phrase associated with a specific aspect term, such as *great*, *terrible*, or *satisfactory*.
- Valence-Arousal (VA): Both valence (V) and arousal (A) are real numbers ranging from 1.00 to 9.00, rounded to two decimal places. A score of 1.00 indicates extremely negative valence or very low arousal; 9.00 indicates extremely positive valence or very high arousal; and 5.00 represents neutral valence or medium arousal.

Different subtasks involve different combinations of the above elements. Participants may choose to participate in one or more of these subtasks.

## Subtask 1: Dimensional Aspect Sentiment Regression (DimASR)

Given a textual instance and one or more target aspects, predict a real-valued **valence-arousal (VA)** score for each aspect. 
The input is in JSON Lines format and includes the following fields.
- "ID" – A unique identifier for the instance.
- "Text" – A sentence or paragraph expressing subjective opinions.
- "Aspect" – A list of one or more target aspects mentioned in the text.

The output should be in JSON Lines format and include the following fields. All textual outputs are **case-sensitive**.

- "ID" – Should match the input ID.
- "Aspect_VA" – A list of pairs, where each pair contains the following fields.
    - "Aspect" – Should be identical in content, case, and order to the Aspect list in the input.
    - "VA" – The valence-arousal score as a string in V#A format, with each value ranging from 1.00 to 9.00 and rounded to two decimal places.

Below are some examples from domains included in this subtask, such as restaurant, laptop, and hotel reviews, and financial reports, and environmental stance detection.
